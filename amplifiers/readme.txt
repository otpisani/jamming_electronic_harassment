45W amplifier

Somewhere in manual states that just PCB board with elements will use around 250mA, and when you solder 
mosfets, the both need to be configure with trimmers to have around 30-35mA per gate side.
If you will buy already build 45W amplifier you will notice that trimmer is very bad for configuring, but 
beacuse it's have very small foot print, there is not to much option, but you can find better trimmers which
are just for fine tuning and tehy need to 5KΩ or 10KΩ
