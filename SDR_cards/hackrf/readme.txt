HackRF One card, !!!THIS IS IMPOSRTANT!!!

You have on the market original Mosmmans hackrf one and also chines clones, NO MATTER what you will buy, no 
matter what hardware design (https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/list_of_hardware_revisions.html), think 
that right now it’s 7 of them, if you going to run hackrf one on daily basics 24/7, you will burn mosfets 
build on cards, and after that you will have card wich can give aroiund 60-70% of normal hackrf one card. 
I have already 3 broken hackrf cards, but I find hardware mods that actually works, and only one Chinese
factory mades this hackrf one cards, called cirket, and links is here https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BYSN6XZZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1


This subject is also processed in more details here https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/issues/541 ,
and Clifford Heath  also made changes, you have option to buy he's changes, and some Chiness company made 
HackrRF with Clifford changes, or you can try to made changes by yourself. I can confirm that Clifford 
HackrRF card actually works for me 24/7 in TX mode, I don't use RX, I also have Chinesse clone from 
original Mossmann HackRF revision r7, and they suffer also from MGA-81563 disease, but must admit r7 last 
much longer for me (around 2 weeks) than previous hardware changes, after that you can't use additional
gain of 14dB.
