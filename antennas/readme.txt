Now I'm having two antennas for home usage and couple of them for carrying in the backpack, that would be 
discone antenna and rod antenna with jumper cable, and antenna has wholes to choose which frequency you like
to scan, obviously is not for jamming, my recommendation is to use discone antenna, widely used for all bands,
means is also good for jamming bigger bandwidth at once, and because I have both antenna, can confirm that 
discone has much better propagation at home, true walls.


!!!!Warnings!!!

Never put antenna outside of the flat, on balcony, because you can be prosecuted by FCC, or similar 
equivalent institution in yours country.
