Pulse jamming is based on this [git code](https://github.com/pietrotedeschi/power-modulated-jammer), he actually pulses at some frequency but with different gain between min and max, which you define in python scipt randomly with random module
Pulse jamming in action if you don't want it download it from git, you can see on  [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/amr2mjaycuoth4i6ent3k/pulse_jam.mp4?rlkey=ouanj5sq4kqxj0lcar0r3fcvn&st=v0bi2g1p&dl=0)

Clever jamming is based on this [repository](https://github.com/jhonnybonny/CleverJAM), best jammer until know that I try for jamming large bandwidth for example from 0-80MHz, operators in charge for me are bleeding, trying to convince me that I'm on the wrong path here, people, nearest neighbors which are on the payrolls, just shifts/pop up here and there in front of me. Family in charge bellow me with, and one family in charge for me next to me (which are responsible for attics) to randomly just show here and there, randomly like "big drummer" says.
With this jamming methods I discover most frequency that are using, and they are making big offense jumping true bandwidth dedicated for other purpose, but what the heck, they are getting that from government. What I was thinking here, that they are around 24.33MHz with some kind of multiplex modulation injecting voices with that same neighbors others, but no, IF you go until level, you will see, that are also between 30-40MHz, and also between 40-60MHz, not sure that 0-80MHz  are ALL from them. 
HOW I discover that, simple, if you actually do jamming them, you will left them without job, and their only task on this planet is to convince you that you are wrong and that is not hope for you, except them, and what they did, simply they jump around whole bandwidth which they didn't used in the past, because I follow that with Pavlova spectrum analyzer for years now, in my home, and outside, this things last for 3-4 years know. When you are not jamming tham, they will lower gain, they don't need it, but when you start behaving strange, like you want your head with yours thoughts, they will put in the third gear, and finally you can discover them with Pavsa spectrum analyzer. Clever jamming is actually sweeping jammer or hopping jammer jump every second more or less, which you can define with -d parameter.
